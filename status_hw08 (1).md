Web Dev Spring 2021 HW08 Status

Answer the following questions:


1. What's your name?

Nick Bagley

2. What's the URL of the github repo with your work for this HW?

https://github.com/nickbagley-git/espa

3. What's the URL that you deployed to?

events-spa.bagleysite.com

4. Is your app functionality complete? If not, what's missing?

There is some functionality missing regarding the limiting of which users
can view certain comments. There is also missing invite functionality.

5. Is your app properly deployed? If not, what went wrong?

The app is not deployed. I made all of the nginx files and service files
for the backend but I could not get them to properly deploy with systemctl.
This makes the front end of the site useless so I could not get the link
between the two. I think there is just a small error somewhere in the configs
but I could not find it.


And here's a list of tasks for grading comments. Just leave this here:
 - Development
 - Deployment
 - Submission
